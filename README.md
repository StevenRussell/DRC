## DRC Project Overview:

In 2015-2017, International Medical Corps (IMC), University Research Co., LLC (URC), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), collaborated on a quality improvement pilot project focused on improving maternal and newborn health outcomes in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The intervention was evaluated using several data collection tools including a patient exit interview. Additionally, clinical observations of births were conducted on a subset of the sample. Using the clinical observations as “gold standard”, we conducted a secondary analysis of the patient exit interviews to determine whether the questions and indicators that were used accurately captured clinical data.
